(##) About this template

* Structure your report using numbers and titles following those of the assignment.

* Replace reference images with your own screenshots or renders when applicable.

* Include descriptions of any encountered problems and the time you spent on each task.

(##) A1T1 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a1.task1.cpp` file and 
checking that transformations can be correctly applied in the GUI.

(##) A1T2 CHECKPOINT

Reference image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/task2-wireframe.png" alt="Rasterize cubes wireframe">
</div>
Please replace the above image with your own screenshot of the rasterized wireframe cubes, but all in **RED**.
This can be done by doing the following:
* Open `media/js3d/A1-cubes.js3d` in the GUI, 
* Set the DrawStyle of every cube to be 'Wireframe', 
* Setting the material of one of the cubes to be a Constant type with a red color,
* Click on the Render tab, then open the Render Window, and use the default settings to rasterize the scene.

Your completion will be graded based on the on the above picture, the reference `test.a1.task2.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing wireframe meshes will look decent.

(##) A1T3 CHECKPOINT

Reference image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/task3-flat-triangles.png" alt="Rasterize flat cubes">
</div>
Please replace the above image with your own screenshot of the rasterized flat triangles cubes, but all in **RED**.
This can be done by doing the following:
* Open `media/js3d/A1-cubes.js3d` in the GUI, 
* Set the DrawStyle of every cube to be 'Flat', 
* Setting the material of one of the cubes to be a Constant type with a red color,
* Click on the Render tab, then open the Render Window, and use the default settings to rasterize the scene.

Your completion will be graded based on the above picture, the reference `test.a1.task3.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing flat triangle meshes will look decent.

(##) A1T4 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. However, please answer the following questions about `media/js3d/A1T4-blend-depth.js3d1`:
* What combination of blend and depth styles would enable us to see three colors?
    * Red: Blend: , Depth: 
    * Green: Blend: , Depth: 
    * Blue: Blend: , Depth: 
* What combination of blend and depth styles would enable us to see five colors?
    * Red: Blend: , Depth: 
    * Green: Blend: , Depth: 
    * Blue: Blend: , Depth: 

Do note that there are multiple correct answers to the above two questions - as long as you provide a valid one, you will receive credit.

Your completion will be graded based on the on the above answers, the reference `test.a1.task4.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing with different blend and depth modes will look decent.

(##) A1T5 FINAL

Reference image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/task5-smooth-correct-triangles.png" alt="Rasterize smooth and correct cubes">
</div>
Please replace the above image with your own screenshot of the rasterized smooth and correct triangles cubes.
This can be done by doing the following:
* Open `media/js3d/A1-cubes.js3d` in the GUI, 
* Set the DrawStyle of the wireframe cube to be 'smooth' and the DrawStyle of the flat cube to be 'correct', 
* Click on the Render tab, then open the Render Window, and use the default settings to rasterize the scene.

Your completion will be graded based on the above picture, the reference `test.a1.task5.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing flat triangle meshes will look decent.

(##) A1T6 FINAL

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a1.task6.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing the samplers scene will look decent.

(##) A1T7 FINAL

Insert a picture of your sample pattern here (up to you on how you created it):
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/task7-sample-pattern.png" alt="Sample pattern">
</div>

Explanation of what your SamplePattern does and scenarios it would do well and poorly in:

Your completion will be graded based on the above answer, the reference `test.a1.task7.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing the samplers scene will look decent.

(##) RASTERIZED IMAGE FINAL

Your image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/rasterize_image.png" alt="Your creation">
</div>
