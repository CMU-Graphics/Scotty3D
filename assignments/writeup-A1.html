(##) About this template

* You can view your writeup by opening it in a browser - right click this file and open with your browser of choice.

* Replace reference images with your own screenshots or renders when applicable.

* Include descriptions of any encountered problems and the time you spent on each task.

* **NOTE: The images you will submit here are different from the images in `A1.md`. Please make sure you are submitting the correct images.**

(##) A1T1 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a1.task1.cpp` file and 
checking that transformations can be correctly applied in the GUI.

(##) A1T2 CHECKPOINT

Reference image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/task2-wireframe.png" alt="Rasterize cubes wireframe">
</div>
Please replace the above image with your own screenshot of the rasterized wireframe cubes, but all in **RED**.
This can be done by doing the following:
* Open `media/js3d/A1-cubes.js3d` in the GUI, 
* Set the DrawStyle of every cube to be 'Wireframe', 
* Setting the material of one of the cubes to be a Constant type with a red color,
* Click on the Render tab, then open the Render Window, and use the default settings to rasterize the scene. You will need to switch from the `Path Tracer` option to `Software Rasterizer` option.

Your completion will be graded based on the on the above picture, the reference `test.a1.task2.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing wireframe meshes will look decent.

(##) A1T3 CHECKPOINT

Reference image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/task3-flat-triangles.png" alt="Rasterize flat cubes">
</div>
Please replace the above image with your own screenshot of the rasterized flat triangles cubes, but all in **RED**.
This can be done by doing the following:
* Open `media/js3d/A1-cubes.js3d` in the GUI, 
* Set the DrawStyle of every cube to be 'Flat', 
* Setting the material of one of the cubes to be a Constant type with a red color,
* Click on the Render tab, then open the Render Window, and use the default settings to rasterize the scene. You will need to switch from the `Path Tracer` option to `Software Rasterizer` option.

Your completion will be graded based on the above picture, the reference `test.a1.task3.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing flat triangle meshes will look decent.

(##) A1T4 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. However, please answer the following questions about `media/js3d/A1T4-blend-depth.js3d1`:
* What combination of blend and depth styles would enable us to see three colors?
    * Red: Blend: , Depth: 
    * Green: Blend: , Depth: 
    * Blue: Blend: , Depth: 
* What combination of blend and depth styles would enable us to see five colors?
    * Red: Blend: , Depth: 
    * Green: Blend: , Depth: 
    * Blue: Blend: , Depth: 

Do note that there are multiple correct answers to the above two questions - as long as you provide a valid one, you will receive credit.

Your completion will be graded based on the on the above answers, the reference `test.a1.task4.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing with different blend and depth modes will look decent.

(##) A1T5 FINAL

Reference image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/task5-smooth-correct-triangles.png" alt="Rasterize smooth and correct cubes">
</div>
Please replace the above image with your own screenshot of the rasterized smooth and correct triangles cubes.
This can be done by doing the following:
* Open `media/js3d/A1-cubes.js3d` in the GUI, 
* Set the DrawStyle of the wireframe cube to be 'smooth' and the DrawStyle of the flat cube to be 'correct', 
* Click on the Render tab, then open the Render Window, and use the default settings to rasterize the scene. You will need to switch from the `Path Tracer` option to `Software Rasterizer` option.

Your completion will be graded based on the above picture, the reference `test.a1.task5.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing flat triangle meshes will look decent.

(##) A1T6 FINAL

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a1.task6.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing the samplers scene will look decent.

(##) A1T7 FINAL

Insert a picture of your sample pattern here (up to you on how you created it):
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/task7-sample-pattern.png" alt="Sample pattern">
</div>

Explanation of what your SamplePattern does and scenarios it would do well and poorly in:

Your completion will be graded based on the above answer, the reference `test.a1.task7.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing the samplers scene will look decent.

(##) RASTERIZED IMAGE FINAL

Your image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/rasterize_image.png" alt="Your creation">
</div>
