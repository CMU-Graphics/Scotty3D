/******************************************************************
*********************** Local Operations **************************
******************************************************************/

/* Note on local operation return types:

    The local operations all return a std::optional<T> type. This is used so that your
    implementation can signify that it cannot perform an operation (i.e., because
    the resulting mesh does not have a valid representation).

    An optional can have two values: std::nullopt, or a value of the type it is
    parameterized on. In this way, it's similar to a pointer, but has two advantages:
    the value it holds need not be allocated elsewhere, and it provides an API that
    forces the user to check if it is null before using the value.

    In your implementation, if you have successfully performed the operation, you can
    simply return the required reference:

            ... collapse the edge ...
            return collapsed_vertex_ref;

    And if you wish to deny the operation, you can return the null optional:

            return std::nullopt;

    Note that the stubs below all reject their duties by returning the null optional.

	Each of the bevel_vertex, bevel_edge, and extrude_face functions do not represent

	the mesh, _not_ the positions of newly created vertices. In fact, you should set
	the positions of new vertices to be exactly the same as wherever they "started from."

	When you click on a mesh element while in bevel mode, one of those three functions
	is called. But, because you may then adjust the distance/offset of the newly
	beveled face, we need another method of updating the positions of the new vertices.

	This is where bevel_positions and extrude_positions come in: these functions are
	called repeatedly as you move your mouse, the position of which determines the
	amount / shrink parameters. These functions are also passed an array of the original
	vertex positions, stored just after the bevel/extrude call, in order starting at
	face->halfedge->vertex, and the original element normal, computed just *before* the
	bevel/extrude call.

	Finally, note that the amount, extrude, and/or shrink parameters are not relative
	values -- you should compute a particular new position from them, not a delta to
	apply.
