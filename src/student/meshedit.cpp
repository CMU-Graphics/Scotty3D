/* Note on local operation return types:

    The local operations all return a std::optional<T> type. This is used so that your
    implementation can signify that it does not want to perform the operation for
    whatever reason (e.g. you don't want to allow the user to erase the last vertex).

    An optional can have two values: std::nullopt, or a value of the type it is
    parameterized on. In this way, it's similar to a pointer, but has two advantages:
    the value it holds need not be allocated elsewhere, and it provides an API that
    forces the user to check if it is null before using the value.

    In your implementaiton, if you have successfully performed the operation, you can
    simply return the required reference:

            ... collapse the edge ...
            return collapsed_vertex_ref;

    And if you wish to deny the operation, you can return the null optional:

            return std::nullopt;

    Note that the stubs below all reject their duties by returning the null optional.

/* Note on the beveling process:

    Each of the bevel_vertex, bevel_edge, and bevel_face functions do not represent
    a full bevel operation. Instead, they should update the _connectivity_ of
    the mesh, _not_ the positions of newly created vertices. In fact, you should set
    the positions of new vertices to be exactly the same as wherever they "started from."

    When you click on a mesh element while in bevel mode, one of those three functions
    is called. But, because you may then adjust the distance/offset of the newly
    beveled face, we need another method of updating the positions of the new vertices.

    This is where bevel_vertex_positions, bevel_edge_positions, and
    bevel_face_positions come in: these functions are called repeatedly as you
    move your mouse, the position of which determins the normal and tangent offset
    parameters. These functions are also passed an array of the original vertex
    positions: for  bevel_vertex, it has one element, the original vertex position,
    for bevel_edge,  two for the two vertices, and for bevel_face, it has the original
    position of each vertex in halfedge order. You should use these positions, as well
    as the normal and tangent offset fields to assign positions to the new vertices.

    Finally, note that the normal and tangent offsets are not relative values - you
    should compute a particular new position from them, not a delta to apply.

/* Note on the quad subdivision process:

        Unlike the local mesh operations (like bevel or edge flip), we will perform
        subdivision by splitting *all* faces into quads "simultaneously."  Rather
        than operating directly on the halfedge data structure (which as you've
        seen is quite difficult to maintain!) we are going to do something a bit nicer:
           1. Create a raw list of vertex positions and faces (rather than a full-
              blown halfedge mesh).
           2. Build a new halfedge mesh from these lists, replacing the old one.
        Sometimes rebuilding a data structure from scratch is simpler (and even
        more efficient) than incrementally modifying the existing one.  These steps are
        detailed below.

  Step I: Compute the vertex positions for the subdivided mesh.
        Here we're going to do something a little bit strange: since we will
        have one vertex in the subdivided mesh for each vertex, edge, and face in
        the original mesh, we can nicely store the new vertex *positions* as
        attributes on vertices, edges, and faces of the original mesh. These positions
        can then be conveniently copied into the new, subdivided mesh.
        This is what you will implement in linear_subdivide_positions() and
        catmullclark_subdivide_positions().

  Steps II-IV are provided (see Halfedge_Mesh::subdivide()), but are still detailed
  here:

  Step II: Assign a unique index (starting at 0) to each vertex, edge, and
        face in the original mesh. These indices will be the indices of the
        vertices in the new (subdivided mesh).  They do not have to be assigned
        in any particular order, so long as no index is shared by more than one
        mesh element, and the total number of indices is equal to V+E+F, i.e.,
        the total number of vertices plus edges plus faces in the original mesh.
        Basically we just need a one-to-one mapping between original mesh elements
        and subdivided mesh vertices.

  Step III: Build a list of quads in the new (subdivided) mesh, as tuples of
        the element indices defined above. In other words, each new quad should be
        of the form (i,j,k,l), where i,j,k and l are four of the indices stored on
        our original mesh elements.  Note that it is essential to get the orientation
        right here: (i,j,k,l) is not the same as (l,k,j,i).  Indices of new faces
        should circulate in the same direction as old faces (think about the right-hand
        rule).

  Step IV: Pass the list of vertices and quads to a routine that clears
        the internal data for this halfedge mesh, and builds new halfedge data from
        scratch, using the two lists.

 * allows elements to be both inserted and removed from the

 * an item by removing it, and re-inserting the same item

 * the smallest priority or "score," even as new elements
 * are inserted and removed.  Priority queues are often an
