    Feedback/Improvements:

    Some of the functions have very specific edge cases that are hard to think of,
    such as collapse edge. Maybe some indication of things to look out for/case on 
    when writing such functions (maybe in the docs?) would be helpful, and might have 
    saved a lot of time trying to debug my isotropic remesh.
